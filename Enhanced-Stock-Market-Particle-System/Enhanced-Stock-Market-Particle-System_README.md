# ⚡ Emergent Stock Monitor | Enhanced Forge Theory

A sophisticated, single-page web application for real-time market monitoring. This tool transcends traditional watchlists by visualizing market dynamics as an **Adaptive Market Particle System**, revealing hidden behavioral patterns, collective sentiment, and core energy states through a custom physics simulation.

## ✨ Features

The Emergent Stock Monitor is packed with features designed for both at-a-glance emergent insights and deep pattern analysis.

### Multiple Viewing Modes

- **Compact View**: A high-level dashboard with color-coded cards showing the symbol, price, and daily change. Perfect for a quick market pulse check.
- **Detailed View**: A list format providing the stock name, volume, and sector.
- **Emergent View (Core Analysis)**: The visualization engine that models the market as a system of interacting particles, where complex dynamics unfold in real-time.

### The Adaptive Emergent System

This model treats each stock as a particle, utilizing advanced physics-based logic to simulate market behavior:

- **Particle Mass (Enhancement 3)**: A particle's size and mass are dynamically calculated based on its **Trading Volume** ($Mass \propto \log(Volume)$). Heavier particles exert a stronger influence on the system's movement and are harder to accelerate.
- **Historical Trail (Enhancement 1)**: Each particle maintains a **Historical Trail** (a memory of its path) on the canvas, showing its recent price movement trajectory.
- **Adaptive Rules (Enhancement 6)**: The core simulation parameters (Attraction, Repulsion, Volatility) automatically **adapt** in real-time based on the system's average speed and clustering, preventing runaway chaos or stagnation.
- **Interactions**: Particles follow enhanced behavioral rules:
    - **Intra-Sector Alignment**: Stocks within the same sector tend to align their velocity (flocking behavior).
    - **Cross-Sector Influence (Enhancement 2)**: Particles are influenced by stocks in other sectors based on a predefined **Correlation Matrix**, modeling macro-market feedback loops.

### Real-Time Emergent Indicators

The Emergent View provides structured interpretation of the complex simulation:

- **Resonance Signals (Enhancement 4)**: A **Resonance Detector** analyzes the oscillation frequency of particle movements. Alerts are triggered when groups of stocks are found to be oscillating at similar frequencies, indicating **synchronized market behavior**.
- **System Energy (Enhancement 5)**: The **Energy Conservation System** calculates the market's current state:
    - **Kinetic Energy**: Represents high motion and chaos.
    - **Potential Energy**: Represents market tension, or energy stored due to conflicting forces.
    - **Energy State**: Classifies the system as 'Kinetic', 'Potential', 'Balanced', or 'Low'.
- **Market Pulse**: Summarizes the market's overall **Momentum** and **Volatility**, classifying the current state (e.g., `BULL EMERGENCE`, `CHAOS EMERGENCE`).
- **Pattern Alerts**: Automatically identifies emergent patterns like **Momentum Clusters** and **Sector Movements**.
- **Trading Signals**: Generates explicit **Buy** or **Sell** signals for individual stocks, derived from a combination of all emergent factors (Momentum, Clustering, Resonance, Energy), with a calculated **Confidence Score**.

### In-Depth Stock Analysis Modal

Clicking a stock card opens a detailed modal with purely emergent-focused data:

- **Particle Properties**: Displays the stock's current emergent properties, including its on-canvas **Position**, **Velocity**, **Mass**, and **Neighbor Count**.
- **Price Trail Chart**: Visualizes the particle's historical trail (position memory) on a 2D plot.
- **Signal History**: Provides a complete, timestamped history of all **Trading Signals** generated for that specific stock by the emergent system, including the triggering reasons and confidence levels.

### Data & Performance

- **Real-Time Data**: Stock prices are fetched from the Yahoo Finance API.
- **Robust Data Export**: Export data for a single stock or the entire system output (including all stock data, market pulse, and system energy) to **JSON** or **CSV**.

## 🔬 The Emergent View Explained

The "Emergent View" is unique because it makes complex, correlated market behavior **visible**. Instead of relying solely on linear metrics, you can *see* the collective tension or coordination. For instance, high **Potential Energy** coupled with a major **Resonance Signal** often precedes a large collective move, offering insights that traditional analysis misses.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, and **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** for all application logic and the custom physics simulation.
- **APIs & Data**:
  - **Source Agnostic Data Feed**: The system utilizes a flexible data ingestion layer designed to handle diverse financial assets, including **Cryptocurrencies** (such as the data used for the Emergent Particle System) and traditional Stocks.
  - **Data Providers**: The application typically integrates with major crypto market data APIs (e.g., CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap) or general market data providers to source real-time **Quote Data** for all monitored assets.
