# 🕹️ GRIDBORN PROTOCOL

AModular 8-Bit Arena Engine for Sovereign Combat

“In the compressed grid, only the mythic endure. Every trail is a lineage. Every crash, a ritual.”

🔮 Overview
Gridborn Protocol is a tactical, 8-bit combat engine where players pilot mythic vehicles across compressed arenas, leaving deadly trails and invoking pixel-bound rituals. Inspired by TRON, Advance Wars, and sovereign builder philosophy, this system fuses retro aesthetics with modular depth.

Built for expansion, lore, and community co-authorship, Gridborn is not just a game—it’s a ritualized battlefield of movement, memory, and myth.

🧱 Core Features
Modular Vehicle Classes: Motorcycles, tanks, planes, ships, and more—each with unique movement, trail logic, and combat roles.
Compressed Grid Combat: Small grids (8×8 to 16×16) amplify tactical density and trail saturation.
Trail-Based Warfare: Every move leaves a trail; every trail is a weapon.
Obstacles & Terrain: Walls, warp nodes, fog tiles, and sigil gates shape the battlefield.
Power-Ups & Power-Downs: Blessings and curses that shift momentum mid-match.
Mythic Lore System: Vehicles, arenas, and pickups are named, storied, and scroll-bound.
8-Bit Aesthetic: Pixel sprites, chiptune FX, and golden-ratio glyphs.

🚗 Vehicle Classes
Each vehicle is a Sigil Vessel, forged by ancient builders and defined by:

Movement Pattern: Speed, turn logic, grid interaction
Trail Behavior: Length, fade rate, collision effect
Combat Role: Zoner, flanker, disruptor, defender

| Class        | Speed  | Trail Type      | Role      | Lore Name      |

🗺️ Arena System
Arenas are Scroll Maps, each defined by:

Grid Size: 8×8, 12×12, 16×16
Terrain Tiles: Road, water, sky, warp zones
Obstacles: Walls, gates, mines, fog, mirrors
Dynamic Events: Gridfolding, collapsing zones, ritual triggers
