# Echo Chip: 8-Bit Hero 🧠⚡

A modular, procedurally generated puzzle-platformer built in Pygame. Echo Chip is more than a game—it's a mythic redemption arc wrapped in pixel art and emergent mechanics. You play as Chip, an amnesiac robot scattered across a ruined city, rebuilding himself through sonic resonance, magnetic manipulation, and memory recovery.

Let me know if you'd like a version tailored for itch.io, Steam, or a pitch deck. We could also modularize this into a `docs/` folder with lore, mechanics, and dev notes.
