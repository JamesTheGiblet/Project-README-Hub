# **SignalCraft: A Disciplined Trading Framework**

From the market's chaos, a framework for discipline emerges.

-----

## **🧠 The Philosophy**

SignalCraft is not a tool for making you money. It's a cognitive mirror. It’s a tool built to reflect and discipline the mind of a trader. Its core principles are the three unbreakable rules of a disciplined practice.

* **Rule of Clarity:** We replace noise with a signal that means something. This engine doesn't react to every price flicker; it looks for volatility-normalized triggers that cut through the illusion of chaos.
* **Rule of Deliberation:** We reject the impulse to act. Every alert from SignalCraft is a prompt for a ritualized response—a sequence of cool-down periods and journaling that separates the signal from your emotion, turning a gut reaction into a conscious, documented decision.
* **Rule of Traceability:** We refuse the black box. Every action, every alert, and every response is meticulously logged and journaled. This creates a teachable, auditable history of discipline, not just profitability.

### **⚙️ Key Features**

| Emoji | Name | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| 📊 | **The Volatility Detector** | Uses ATR and rolling windows to detect meaningful shifts in the market, ensuring every alert is a real signal of change. |
| 📜 | **The Journaling Engine** | A stateful system that tracks all past alerts, prices, and actions to build a historical record of your decision-making. |
| ⏱️ | **The Cooldown Timer** | Implements a delay and deliberate steps for a disciplined response, preventing impulsive trades. |
| 🧪 | **Shadow Mode** | A live simulation mode that lets you run the engine without notifications, so you can train and validate without risk. |
| 📉 | **The Risk Reckoner** | Tracks not just profits, but the quality of the signals and the risk profile of your decisions. |

### **🚀 Getting Started**

To begin your journey, follow these steps.

**Installation:**

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/signalcraft.git
cd signalcraft

# Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Running Shadow Mode:**
Run the engine in shadow mode to observe its signals without taking action. This is the only way to start.

```bash
# Begin silent observation
python signalcraft.py --mode shadow
```

-----

### **🛠️ Configuration**

SignalCraft is configured through its strategy logic, which is defined by clear, declarative rules.

* **Dip Detection:** Alerts on a fall of \>1.5x ATR below the 72-hour high.
* **Surge Detection:** Alerts on a rise of \>2x ATR above the 72-hour low.
* **BTC Allocation Rule:** A core discipline that dictates profits are held in stable assets until BTC volatility dips below a certain threshold.

-----

### **📊 How It Works**

* **The Alert:** When a dip is detected, you get a notification with a brief, disciplined phrase, not an emotional call to action.
* **The Journaling Prompt:** After an alert is acknowledged, the engine prompts you to record your reasoning and intended action, creating an audit trail of your cognitive process.
* **The Replay:** Use the replay mode to test a new strategy against historical data before you risk any real money.

### **🧬 Contributing**

We invite you to join the team and help refine this engine. Your contributions are not just lines of code; they are acts of philosophical alignment.

**The Four Archetypes of the Team:**

* **The Scout:** Finds new volatility patterns and logs them, documenting the raw signs of the market.
* **The Sentinel:** Validates the core logic, testing new thresholds to ensure the signal stays honest.
* **The Archivist:** Maintains the integrity of the trade journal and performance metrics, ensuring the history is never corrupted.
* **The Alchemist:** Experiments with new allocation rules and asset classes, looking for new forms of disciplined practice.

-----

### **🏟️ The Rules for Contributions**

All contributions are measured against a single standard: **epistemic discipline**.

* **The Precision Trial:** Does your change improve the Alert Precision metric, leading to more profitable setups?
* **The Drawdown Gauntlet:** Does your proposed ritual reduce the Max Drawdown when tested against historical data?
* **The Time-to-Decision Trial:** Does your UI/UX improvement decrease the Time-to-Decision metric while maintaining the integrity of the journaling ritual?
