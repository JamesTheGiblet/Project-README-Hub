## 🧠 ChronoScribe: Generic Ritualized Ingestion Module

### 🔧 Purpose  
A modular ingestion engine that transforms raw data into cognitive artifacts. It’s not bound to PAT testing—it can handle inspection logs, sensor data, compliance records, or even contributor actions. The ritual stays the same: timestamp, validate, sign, and teach.

### 🧩 Core Features

| Feature               | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Schema-Agnostic Ingestion** | Accepts any JSON/YAML/CSV payload with a declared schema or ritual contract |
| **Traceability Layer** | Adds timestamp, contributor ID, and checksum to every record                |
| **Validation Rituals** | Pluggable validators for field presence, type, and mnemonic integrity        |
| **Export Contracts**   | Ritualized handoffs to downstream modules with signed payloads              |
| **Badge Hooks**        | Tracks contributor actions and unlocks cognitive badges based on behavior   |

### 🧪 Onboarding Ritual (Generic)

```bash
chronoscribe init --ritual
chronoscribe ingest --file inspection_log.csv --schema inspection_v1
chronoscribe audit --ritual inspection_v1
chronoscribe export --handoff reporting
```

This flow teaches contributors:
- How to declare schemas
- How to validate traceability
- How to sign and export records
- How to earn badges through epistemic integrity

### 🧬 Schema Declaration

```yaml
schema_id: inspection_v1
fields:
  - name: device_id
    type: string
    required: true
  - name: inspector
    type: string
    required: true
  - name: result
    type: enum
    values: [pass, fail]
    required: true
  - name: timestamp
    type: datetime
    required: true
ritual:
  mnemonic: "Every inspection must be timestamped, signed, and retrievable."
  archetype: "The Certifier"
```

This makes ChronoScribe a **ritualized schema engine**—each schema encodes not just structure, but contributor mindset.

### 🧠 Health Schema (Generic)

| Dimension         | Checkpoint                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Traceability**  | Are all records timestamped and signed?                                    |
| **Schema Integrity** | Do records conform to declared schema?                                 |
| **Mnemonic Drift**| Does the ingestion ritual still teach its core mnemonic?                   |
| **Contributor Clarity** | Can a new contributor understand and extend the module within 30 minutes? |

### 🏷 Badge Schema (Generic)

| Badge         | Unlock Condition                                      | Symbolism                        |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Initiate**  | Complete onboarding ritual with any schema             | 🧭 First steps in cognitive ingestion |
| **Validator** | Submit 100 records with zero schema violations         | ✅ Guardian of structure         |
| **Archivist** | Export 10 signed payloads with full traceability       | 📚 Steward of data integrity     |
| **Schema Sage** | Author 3 new schemas with embedded mnemonics        | 🧠 Ritual architect              |

---
- Refactor the CLI to support dynamic schema loading
- Build a schema registry with embedded mnemonics and archetypes
- Design a contributor dashboard that tracks badge progress and ritual mastery
- Prototype a “ritual replay” feature that lets contributors simulate ingestion flows for training
