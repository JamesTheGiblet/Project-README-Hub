## About The Project

Our mission is to supercharge the development workflow by providing powerful, intuitive, and modular tools. We believe that developers should spend less time on repetitive, boilerplate tasks and more time on what truly matters: creating innovative products. This repository contains the main marketing website and the individual tool applications.

## ⚠️ Important: Development Server Required

This project uses JavaScript to load reusable components (like the header and footer) and uses root-relative paths (e.g., `/css/main.css`) for assets.

**Because of this, you cannot simply open the `index.html` file directly in your browser (using a `file:///...` path).**

You **must** run the project through a local web server. The easiest way to do this is with the **Live Server** extension for Visual Studio Code. First, open the entire `ModularDev.tools` folder in VS Code, then right-click `index.html` and choose "Open with Live Server".

---

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the main website up and running, follow these simple steps.

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ModularDev-Tools/website.git
    cd website
    ```

2. **Open the `ModularDev.tools` folder in your code editor (like VS Code).** Then, use a live-server extension to open `index.html`.
    *(See the "Development Server Required" note above for more details.)*

### For Tool-Specific Development

Each tool in the `/tools` directory is a standalone project with its own dependencies and setup instructions. Please refer to the `README.md` inside each tool's folder for detailed setup guides.

* `./tools/design-system/README.md`
* `./tools/api-docs/README.md`
