## **Project: Random-Art**

A Simple Generative Art Script

-----

#### **The Story Behind It**

Sometimes you just want to build something fun over a weekend. I was curious to see what kind of weird patterns I could generate just by feeding random data into Matplotlib. This project was a playground for messing with algorithms and seeing what came out.

It's a simple script, but it’s a great example of how you can get some cool, unpredictable results from a few lines of code and a bit of math.

-----

#### **What It Does**

  * **Generates Random Patterns:** It runs algorithms to produce unique, abstract art.
  * **Customizable:** You can dive into the code and tweak the parameters to change the shapes, colors, and patterns.
  * **Python-Powered:** It's a simple script that uses common Python libraries.
  * **Exportable:** You can save the generated images as files.

-----

#### **The Tech**

It’s a straightforward Python script built on a couple of solid libraries:

  * **Matplotlib** for plotting and creating the images.
  * **Numpy** for handling the arrays and generating the random data.

#### **How to Run It**

Clone the repo, install the dependencies, and run the script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/Random-Art.git
cd Random-Art
pip install -r requirements.txt
python random_art.py
```

#### **Ideas for a V2**

**Perfect is the imaginary friend of never shipped**, but if I were to build on this, I'd:

  * Add more complex algorithms for more intricate designs.
  * Build a simple UI to change parameters in real-time.
  * Allow user input (like mouse movements) to influence the patterns.

#### **What I Learned**

This was a fun project. It's a good reminder that you can create cool visual stuff with just a few lines of code. The hardest part, honestly, was getting the color palettes to not look like a complete mess. It was a nice break from more complex systems.

#### **License**

This project is licensed under the **MIT License**. Have fun with it.

It's a simple script, but **the code is the proof** that sometimes the most interesting results come from a bit of randomness.
