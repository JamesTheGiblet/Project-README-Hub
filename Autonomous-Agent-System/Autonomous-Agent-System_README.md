Project: Autonomous Agent System (AAS)

A modular, on-premise framework for autonomous agents.

A Quick Note on Ownership

This is important, so I'm putting it right at the top. This is my personal project, built on my own time with my own tools. It has nothing to do with my day job or any other company. I designed it, I wrote the code, and I own it. Simple as that.

The Problem

Humans, and the expensive AI Copilots that assist them, waste too much time on repetitive digital tasks—formatting documents, running scripts, checking data, etc. Most of this grunt work doesn't require a high-level AI; it just needs a simple, reliable bot to get it done.

The Solution

A simple, secure, and on-premise framework for running an army of small, specialized agents. Each agent is a containerized bot designed to do a specific job. They pull tasks from a queue, grab the skills they need from a central library, and only escalate to a human when they get stuck. It’s about offloading the grunt work so your skilled people can focus on real problems.

The Architecture

At its core, this is a distributed system designed for local, secure processing.

    Deployment: It runs on your own Linux servers (Ubuntu/RHEL) and uses Podman for rootless containers. This keeps it secure and simple.

    Resource Control: I'm using systemd and Podman to strictly limit how much CPU and memory each agent can use. No single agent can crash the whole system.

    Local-First: All data processing happens on your network. Nothing is sent to the cloud unless a human explicitly approves it.

The Key Parts

The system is made of a few main components:

    The Agent: Each agent is a lightweight FastAPI microservice running in a container. It has a TaskExecutor to run jobs, a MemoryEngine (using TinyDB) to remember what it's learned, and a SelfImprover to get better based on human feedback.

    The Skill Library (Pantheon): This is a central git repository or shared filesystem where all the agent "skills" (Python scripts) are stored, versioned, and categorized. An agent fetches a skill from here if it doesn't have it cached locally.

    The Human Fallback (Copilot Bridge): If an agent fails at a task, it doesn't just crash. It flags the task for human review. An authorized staff member can then process the task, and the annotated result is fed back to the agent's SelfImprover module so it can learn from the failure.

    Monitoring: Using standard tools like Prometheus and Grafana to watch resource usage, failure rates, and task stats. No black boxes.

Security (The Guard Rails)

Security is baked in, not bolted on.
Mechanism	Purpose
RBAC	Role-based access for agents and the skill library.
Audit Trail	Immutable logs for every action an agent takes.
Data Sandbox	Agents run in read-only folders.
Manual Escalation	Requires 2FA for a human to handle a fallback task.

The Workflows

1. How an Agent Gets a Task

Code snippet

flowchart TD
    A[User submits task] --> B[Agent receives task]
    B --> C{Skill cached locally?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Run skill in sandbox]
    D --> E[Log result]
    C -->|No| G[Query Skill Library]
    G --> H[Download & verify skill]
    H --> D
    H -->|Fail| I[Flag for Human Fallback]
    I --> J[Manual Approval]
    J --> K[Human processes task]
    K --> L[Annotated result returned]
    L --> E

2. How to Add a New Skill

    A developer commits a new Python skill script to the Skill Library repo.

    An automated CI/CD pipeline runs a linter and a sandbox test.

    If it passes, the skill is versioned and indexed in the database.

    Agents with the right permissions can now pull and use this new skill.

The Roadmap

The project is broken down into logical phases. Perfect is the imaginary friend of never shipped.
Phase	Scope	Outcome
Phase 1	Core Agent System + Skill Library	A working proof-of-concept.
Phase 2	Alpha Deployment with Human Fallback	Real-world use and feedback loop.
Phase 3	Skill Search & Agent Tiering	Making the system smarter and more organized.
Phase 4	Federated Deployment	Allowing multiple teams to share agents.
Phase 5	Contributor Tools & Onboarding	Making it easy for others to build skills.

Licensing & Ownership

Let me be crystal clear. This is my project. The code, the architecture, and the documentation are my intellectual property unless explicitly stated otherwise.

My proposed model is simple:

    The core framework and documentation are free for public use (likely under an MIT license).

    Detailed roadmaps, deployment guides, and consulting would be paid services.

This is a framework for building your own army of digital helpers. Stop doing the grunt work manually. Build first, ask permission never.
