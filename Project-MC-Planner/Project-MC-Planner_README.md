![MC Planner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0.0-blue.svg)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)
![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-Web%20%7C%20Raspberry%20Pi%20%7C%20ESP32-orange.svg)

## Overview

MC Planner is an intuitive web-based application designed to simplify GPIO planning for microcontroller projects. Whether you're working with Raspberry Pi, ESP32, or other microcontrollers, MC Planner helps you visualize pinouts, select optimal GPIO pins for your components, and generate configuration details for your projects.

### Interactive Pinout

Visualize your board's pinout with an interactive, color-coded diagram. Click on pins to assign them to components and see your configuration come to life.

## Installation

### Web Version

Simply visit [mcplanner.com](https://mcplanner.com) to use the web application.

### Local Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mc-planner.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd mc-planner

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

### Docker Installation

```bash
# Pull the Docker image
docker pull yourusername/mc-planner:latest

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 yourusername/mc-planner
```

## Usage

### 1. Select Your Board

Choose from the supported microcontroller boards. The pinout diagram will update automatically.

### 2. Add Components

Fill in the component form with details about your sensor or equipment:

- Component type (sensor, motor, display, etc.)
- Voltage requirements
- Communication protocol (I2C, SPI, UART, etc.)
- Current draw
- Special requirements

### 3. Review Recommendations

MC Planner will suggest optimal GPIO pins based on your component's requirements and current board configuration.

### 4. Assign Pins

Click on pins in the visual diagram to assign them to your components.

### 5. Export Configuration

Download your pinout configuration as:

- JSON file for import into other tools
- PDF schematic diagram
- Code snippets for popular platforms (Arduino, MicroPython, CircuitPython)

## API Integration

MC Planner provides a REST API for integration with other tools and services:

```javascript
// Example: Get pin recommendations for a component
POST /api/recommend-pins
{
  "board": "raspberry-pi-4",
  "component": {
    "type": "sensor",
    "protocol": "i2c",
    "voltage": "3.3v",
    "current": 20
  }
}
```
