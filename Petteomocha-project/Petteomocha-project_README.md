## **Project: Petteomocha**

A Python-Based Digital Pet

-----

### **The Story Behind It**

After building the M.I.L.O. chatbot, I wanted to try something more playful and visual. The idea was simple: build a **Tamagotchi-style digital pet** in Python. It's a project that combines game logic with user interaction—something you have to feed, play with, and keep happy.

This project was the critical bridge between my purely software projects (like M.I.L.O.) and my later move into robotics (like G.I.S.M.O.). It taught me how to manage an application's state over time, how to build a simple gameplay loop, and how to create something that was meant to be engaging, not just functional.

### **What It Is**

Petteomocha is a simple digital pet experience.

  * **Virtual Pet Gameplay:** You have to take care of your pet by feeding it, playing with it, and cleaning up after it. Its stats will change based on your actions.
  * **Evolution:** Based on how well you care for it, your pet will grow and evolve into different forms.
  * **Responsive:** The pet's behavior and animations change depending on its needs and mood.
  * **Modular Code:** It was built to be easy to hack on, so you can add new features or create your own custom pets.

### **The Tech**

It's a straightforward **Python project**. The goal was to focus on the game logic and state management without getting bogged down by a complex framework.

### **How to Run It**

Clone the repo, install the dependencies, and run the main script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/Petteomocha-project.git
cd Petteomocha-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
python petteomocha.py
```

### **Ideas for a V2**

**Perfect is the imaginary friend of never shipped**, but if I were to build a second version, I'd add:

  * More complex evolution paths.
  * Voice commands for interacting with the pet.
  * A better visual UI instead of just a basic command-line interface.

### **What I Learned**

This was a fun build, but it came with its own challenges. Designing a gameplay loop that's engaging without being annoying is harder than it looks. This project taught me a lot about balancing stats and creating a user experience that makes people want to come back. It was a great lesson in making something fun, not just functional.
