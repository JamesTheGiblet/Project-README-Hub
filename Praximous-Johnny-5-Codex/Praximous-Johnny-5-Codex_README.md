# **Project: Johnny 5 "Number 3"**

A Build Guide for an Advanced Robotics Platform

---

## **Disclaimer: Read This First**

Let's get this out of the way. This is a hard project. You're dealing with LiPo batteries, multiple processors, high-torque servos, and a lot of custom wiring. If you don't know what you're doing, you can break expensive components or, worse, hurt yourself.

This guide is a map, not a safety net. **You build this at your own risk.** Be smart, be safe, and double-check your connections.

### **The Big Idea**

This isn't just about building a replica of a movie robot. This is an engineering challenge to create a complex, multi-brain robot on a modular platform. It's my take on a classic, designed for builders who want a serious project.

### **What's in this Repo**

This repository is your **starter kit**. It contains the essential files—the parts list, wiring key, and license—to get you started.

**[See a full breakdown of the files in this repo.](docs/whats-in-this-repo.md)**

---

### **What You'll Need**

This is an **intermediate-level project** that requires a specific set of skills, tools, and components.

**[Check the full requirements here.](docs/what-youll-need.md)**

---

### **The Build Plan: A Phased Approach**

A complex build needs a clear plan. The project is broken down into six logical phases, from the foundational chassis to the final intelligent behaviors.

**[See the high-level build plan here.](docs/the-build-plan.md)**

---

### **The Core Subsystems**

The robot is designed as a set of interacting subsystems, including a unique multi-brain architecture. Understanding these is key to a successful build.

**[Learn about the core subsystems here.](docs/the-core-subsystems.md)**

### **Want the Full Guide? (The Premium Roadmap)**

This free repository gives you the "what." The full premium roadmap gives you the **"how"**—the complete, step-by-step guide with all the code, STL files, and detailed tutorials.

**[Find out how to get the full guide here.](docs/want-the-full-guide.md)**

### **How to Contribute**

If you build one and find a better way to do something, I'm always open to good ideas from other builders.

**[Read the contribution guide here.](docs/how-to-contribute.md)**

This is a serious build for serious builders. It will test your skills. **The build is the proof.** Let's make something amazing.
