## 🏆 Project Status: v1.0.0 (Gold)

**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**
The platform migration is complete. All legacy HTML tools have been converted into a modular plugin architecture.

### Milestones

- ✅ **Phase 1:** Foundation & Core Architecture (Completed)
- ✅ **Phase 2:** Studio Migration (8/8 Studios Migrated)
- ✅ **Phase 3:** UI Polish & Cleanup (Legacy code removed)

## 🛠️ Studio Suite

The platform currently hosts **8 specialized design studios**:

| Studio | Function | Engine |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Sign Studio** | Text → Brick Signs | `Voxelizer.fromText` |
| **2. QR Studio** | Data → Scannable Codes | `QRCode.js` Integration |
| **3. Mosaic Studio** | Photo → Pixel Art | `Voxelizer.fromImage` |
| **4. Relief Studio** | Image → Height Maps | Luminance Processing |
| **5. Architect Studio** | Photo → Building Facades | Simulation Engine |
| **6. Vertical Sign** | Text → 3D Standing Models | Three.js Rendering |
| **7. Pendant Studio** | Initials → Jewelry | Algorithmic Design |
| **8. 3D Studio** | STL/JSON → Voxel Models | Procedural Generation |

## 📂 Architecture Overview

BlockForge uses a **Plugin-Based Architecture** to keep studios isolated while sharing core resources.

### 1. The Contract (Manifest)

Every plugin uses a strict `manifest.json` to define its identity, UI tools, and panels. This allows the Core to load studios dynamically without hard-coding.

### 2. Core System

- **Plugin Loader:** Scans `plugins/` directory and registers manifests.

- **UI Generator:** dynamically builds toolbars (Sliders, Color Pickers, File Uploads) based on the manifest.

### 3. Shared Library (`src/shared/`)

- **`Voxelizer`**: The math engine for converting 2D/3D data into grids.

- **`BrickOptimizer`**: Logic for merging 1x1 voxels into larger bricks (1x2, 1x3).
- **`Exporters`**: Standardized generation of `.csv` (BOM), `.png` (Render), and `.html` (Instructions).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
npm install

```

### 2. Register PluginsIf you add a new studio folder, run the scanner to register it

```bash
npm run scan-plugins

```

### 3. Run Development Server```bash

npm run dev

```

> Open `http://localhost:3000` to launch the platform.

###4. Build for Production```bash
npm run build

```

> Creates a `dist/` folder ready for deployment (Vercel/Netlify).
