**MetaLanguageForge** is a browser-based interactive simulator for exploring the art and science of programming language design. It allows you to experiment with paradigms, constraints, and features, visualizing how these choices create trade-offs in performance, safety, and usability. The app is styled with a retro neon arcade aesthetic and is fully mobile-responsive.

## 🏛️ The Philosophy

Every programming language is a universe of trade-offs. A feature that boosts performance might sacrifice safety. A paradigm that enhances readability might reduce raw speed. MetaLanguageForge makes these abstract concepts tangible.

It's built on a simple idea: **Language design is an evolutionary process.** By allowing you to "forge" and "evolve" languages, the simulator reveals the hidden pressures and constraints that have shaped the tools we use to build software every day. It's a playground for asking "what if?"

## ✨ Features

### 🛠️ **Core Simulator**

- **Paradigm Selection:** Choose from 5 fundamental paradigms: `Object-Oriented`, `Functional`, `Imperative`, `Logical`, and `Reactive`.
- **Constraint Toggles:** Mix and match 8 design goals: `High Performance`, `Memory Safety`, `Concurrency`, `Readability`, `Expressiveness`, `Security`, `Scalability`, and `Easy Learning`.
- **Real-Time Score Preview:** Instantly see how your choices impact `Performance` and `Safety` scores with a dynamic, glowing radar chart.
- **Instant Language Generation:** Click "Simulate" to generate a detailed language specification based on your inputs.

### 📜 **Generated Specification**

- **Detailed Spec:** Each language comes with a generated `Type System`, `Concurrency Model`, `Memory Model`, and a list of `Key Features`.
- **Code Example:** See a "Hello, World!" or a simple function written in the syntax of your newly created language.
- **Unique Name & Version:** Every language gets a procedurally generated name (e.g., "AetherScript 1.0") for flavor.

### 🧬 **Evolution & Comparison**

- **Evolution Simulation:** Simulate 5 generations of language evolution, showing how scores and features can shift over time under consistent design pressures.
- **Visual Timeline:** View the evolution results in a mobile-friendly, scrollable timeline chart, tracking `Performance` and `Safety` scores across generations.
- **Compare Languages:** Place any two generated languages in a side-by-side comparison view, automatically highlighting their unique and shared features.

### 💾 **Export & Share**

- **Save as Text:** Download a clean, human-readable `.txt` file of your language spec.
- **Export as JSON:** Download a structured `.json` file of a single language or the full evolution timeline for machine-readable analysis.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Quickly copy the entire spec to share it anywhere.

### 🎮 **UI/UX**

- **Retro Neon Aesthetics:** A fun, engaging interface inspired by 80s arcade games, with glowing text and a dark theme.
- **Fully Responsive:** Designed to work seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Mobile Touch Optimized:** Features large tap targets, scrollable modals, and a layout that adapts to small screens.
- **Keyboard Accessible:** Navigate and interact with all controls using a keyboard.

## 🚀 Quick Start

No installation or setup required!

1. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
2. That's it! The simulator is ready to go.

### **Basic Workflow**

1. **🧪 Experiment with Inputs:**
    - Click a **Paradigm** button (e.g., `Functional`).
    - Toggle the **Constraint** switches (e.g., enable `Memory Safety` and `Concurrency`).
    - Watch the **Score Preview** radar chart change in real-time.

2. **🤖 Generate Your Language:**
    - Click the big **"Simulate Language Design"** button.
    - A modal will appear with your complete language specification.

3. **💾 Save or Share:**
    - Use the buttons at the bottom of the modal to `Download as Text`, `Export as JSON`, or `Copy to Clipboard`.

4. **🧬 Evolve It:**
    - Close the modal and click **"Simulate Language Evolution"**.
    - See how a language might change over 5 generations to better meet your chosen constraints.

5. **⚖️ Compare Two Designs:**
    - Generate two different languages.
    - Click **"Compare Languages"** and select them from the dropdowns to see a detailed comparison.

## 📁 File Structure

The project is intentionally simple and self-contained.

```txt
└── 📂 metalanguageforge/
    └── 📄 index.html  (All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file)
```

- **No Dependencies:** Relies only on vanilla JavaScript and a single Google Font (`Orbitron`) for the retro style.
- **No Build Step:** Open the file and it works. Edit the code and refresh to see changes.

---

## 🔧 Customization

Since all the logic is in `index.html`, customization is straightforward.

- **Modify Paradigms/Constraints:** Edit the `paradigms` and `constraints` objects in the `<script>` section to change their names or scoring impact.
- **Adjust Scoring Logic:** The `calculateScores` and `generateLanguageSpec` functions contain the core logic for how features are selected and scores are determined.
- **Change Styles:** All CSS is in the `<style>` section. Tweak colors, fonts, and animations to your liking.

## 🎯 Use Cases

### **🎓 Educational Tool**

- Visually teach students the trade-offs in programming language design.
- Demonstrate how paradigms like Functional and OOP influence language features.
- Provide a fun, interactive tool for computer science courses.

### **💡 For Hobbyists & Designers**

- Brainstorm ideas for your own programming language.
- Quickly prototype different feature combinations.
- Explore the relationship between high-level design goals and concrete language features.

### **🤔 For Developers**

- Gain a deeper appreciation for why your favorite language is designed the way it is.
- Understand the inherent challenges of creating a language that is simultaneously fast, safe, and easy to use.
